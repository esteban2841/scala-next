The bar stands as the centerpiece: sculptural, commanding, and surrounded by soft neutral tones, pale wood, and matte blue detailing. Generous circulation space and optimized visibility ensure operational ease without sacrificing warmth or presence.',
      'Custom furniture and backdrops allow each guest interaction to feel curated and personal, while large storefront glass brings in light and connection to the outside. This is architecture that knows how to perform—but also how to feel.',
      'With this prototype, Scala translated operational needs into architectural poetry. The One Floor Prototype isn’t just a template—it’s a spatial expression designed for scalability, community, and brand soul.'

      "A kitchen that captures light like a lens captures a memory. L.A Kitchen is a sensorial dialogue between softness and structure, designed for a home where cooking becomes a poetic ritual. Creamy onyx surfaces stretch like quiet landscapes across counters and walls, catching the golden glow of custom brass accents and a sculptural faucet that feels more like jewelry than utility. The space dances with contrast—matte ivory cabinetry floats above warm walnut bases, anchored by the glow of integrated lighting and a whimsical neon pendant that sketches heartbeats in mid-air. Every line is precise, yet nothing feels rigid. The island, wrapped in cascading stone, invites touch, conversation, and stillness all at once. This project was not just about crafting a functional kitchen—it was about composing a space that inspires. A space where design becomes part of daily life, and elegance is not something to observe, but something to live in.",

      'The 3D visualization tells a story of presence: soft light sweeping across textured walls, seamlessly revealing spaces that feel both grounded and elevated. As the camera moves, each vignette—workstations, lounges, meeting nooks—unfolds like a frame from a thoughtfully directed sequence. The palette is subdued yet rich; the mood, intentional yet effortless.',

      'With FD 100, Scala didn’t just present an office. We premiered a world. One where design speaks through motion, and brand culture is built, quite literally, in frames'
