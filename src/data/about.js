  visionTextLeft: `Imagine stepping into a space that resonates with your very essence, an environment where every line,
  every texture, tells a story of intention and beauty. This is the promise of Scala. Since 1996, we've been
  more than creators of architectural solutions; we've been storytellers in steel, light, and form, shaping
  the backdrops for countless lives across the globe.
  In 2022, fueled by a desire to deepen our impact, Scala embraced a powerful evolution. Like a sculptor
  refining their masterpiece, we sharpened our focus, amplifying our commitment to crafting spaces that
  not only serve a purpose but also stir the soul.`,

  visionTextRight: `Today, Scala is a vibrant movement—a collective of visionary designers, artists, and thinkers united by
  the belief that extraordinary spaces have the power to inspire, connect, and endure. We don&#39;t just see
  buildings or interiors—we envision the experiences they will hold, the memories they will frame.
  Step into the world of Scala, where our vision goes beyond simple design. We meticulously consider the
  soul of every space, hand-selecting materials that tell stories of quality and intention, and imbue each
  project with a profound sense of purpose. Here, spaces are not simply transformed, they are cultivated
  into immersive experiences that elevate the very fabric of everyday life.`,
